# Analysis of Cross-Lingual Embedding Alignment Using WeightWatcher and Spectral Density Measures

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the similarity and transferability of cross-lingual embeddings, using a combination of WeightWatcher analysis, Empirical Spectral Density (ESD) measures, and similarity measures including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance, Pearson correlation, and cosine similarity.

## Description

In recent years, machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have been highly successful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Specifically, pre-trained language models with shared cross-lingual embeddings, such as mBERT and XLM, have shown promising results in multilingual tasks. However, there's a pressing need for tools and techniques to analyze the quality and transferability of these models, especially when being used for low-resource languages.

This project aims to develop a method for evaluating the alignment of the cross-lingual embeddings for different languages, which is a key factor in the success of transfer learning for these languages.

The project will make use of the WeightWatcher tool, which can analyze the weight matrices of a deep learning model and provide insights about its generalization capability and potential issues. The project will apply WeightWatcher to the cross-lingual model to understand the power-law behavior of the singular values of the weight matrices.

Additionally, the project will compute the ESDs of the weight matrices and use them to compute the K-S distance, Pearson correlation, and cosine similarity between the ESDs of different languages' embeddings. The project will also explore an innovative method to combine these measures using exponential transformations to create a unified similarity measure.

## Expected Outcomes:
By the end of the project, we aim to:

1.  Develop a systematic approach for applying WeightWatcher to analyze the quality of cross-lingual embeddings.
2. Establish a methodology for calculating and interpreting the K-S distance, Pearson correlation, and cosine similarity between the ESDs of different languages' embeddings.
3. Propose a combined measure that captures different aspects of the similarity between the ESDs of different languages' embeddings, and interpret its implications for transfer learning.
4. Validate this approach on a range of cross-lingual models and different language pairs, and evaluate its effectiveness in predicting the success of transfer learning tasks.
This project has the potential to significantly improve our ability to understand and evaluate cross-lingual models, and thereby enhance their application in multilingual NLP tasks.
