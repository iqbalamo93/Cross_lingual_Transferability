# Analysis of Cross-Lingual Embedding Alignment Using WeightWatcher and Spectral Density Measures

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the similarity and transferability of cross-lingual embeddings, using a combination of WeightWatcher analysis, Empirical Spectral Density (ESD) measures, and similarity measures including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance, Pearson correlation, and cosine similarity.
